# Student Grades Management System (Java)

## Overview

A console-based Java application that manages student grades using object-oriented programming principles.

The system allows the user to enter multiple students, record up to 10 grades per student, calculate each student's average grade, display the results, and save them to a text file.

---

## Objectives

- Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java
- Use arrays to store and manage student grades
- Handle user input using Scanner
- Perform average grade calculations
- Save output results to a text file using FileWriter

---
## How the Program Works

1. The user enters the number of students.
2. For each student:
   - Enter student name.
   - Enter grades (negative number stops grade input).
3. The program calculates each student's average.
4. Results are displayed in the console.
5. Results are saved to `student_grades.txt`.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates practical application of problem-solving strategies using Java, incorporating arrays, loops, object-oriented design, user input handling, and file operations.
